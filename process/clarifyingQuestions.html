            <br>
            <ol>
                <li> Do students more often refer to their personal goals first or to their academic goals first when they come to advising? </li>
                <li> Are students comfortable sharing their personal goals with undergraduate advising straight away, or does it take a few tries? </li>
                <li> How often are students able to overlap personal goals with their academic goals?
                </li>
                <li>
                Would it help undergraduate advisors to know of the personal goals of students in addition to their academic ones?
                </li>
                <li>
                If so, what kind of information would be most helpful for undergraduate advisors to know?
                </li>
