            <br>
             <p> <strong>I want to turn my annual goals list into a form that will make my goals quantifiable. It can become a tool for others to do the same. </strong> </p>
            <br>
            <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At the beginning of every academic year, I sit down by myself in a coffee shop for at least five hours and try to brainstorm on what an ideal year would look like. What do I wish to accomplish? What are my priorities? The idea is to pinpoint in writing exactly what I want as throughly as possible. It covers many categories such as: Quotes to Live by, General/Overall, Time Management, School + Academics, Career + Learning, Travel, Friendships + Relationships, Family, Spiritual, Networking and Social Media, Finances, Personal, Health + Maintenance, Fun Things. These categories are often broken down into subcategories.  No dream is too big, and I try not to let things that seem impossible stop me from writing it down.
                <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good thing about this? Attempted consistency. Things are never done properly if the things that we want change as the leaves turn with the wind. While I personally do understand them at an instinctual level, they’re largely based on feelings and self-perception. As the year goes on, things change, and I’ve had to adjust my goals, sometimes destroying records of goals previously made. Where’s the balance between change and consistency? Another problem is that none of these goals are quantifiable. While I do understand them, they’re largely based on feelings that only I fully understand and self-percieve.
                <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the new year, instead of making new year resolutions, I do a mid-year check-in and see what’s working, what’s not working, and what things I can do to improve different situations.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong> Things that I've tried in the past: </strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Reading the document once in the morning and once at night everyday (immersion).  </li>
                <li>Weekly check ins to see where each goal is and how what the progress looks like. (I find that doing this helps me keep on track and generally improves mental stability and happiness throughout the year so I don’t feel that things are getting out of control.)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
