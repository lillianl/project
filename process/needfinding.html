             <p> <strong> Step 1: Observe </strong> </p>
             <p> Setting the stage:  “Kelvin, could you navigate through this app and narrate outloud what your are doing?” </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Kelvin: “I keep trying to get to the nav menu, but your messenger app notifications keep getting in the way” </li>

                    <li>"I’m going to try and tap on this information — oh — no, I can’t interact with it. [is referring to the visual data of cumulative data on the first four sliding screens]"</li>

                    <li> "If i turn this off, it brings up this thing.  what does that mean? [ referring to the awake and asleep toggle on the home screen ] OH, that’s for like NIGHT and DAY. Oh i get that. so i’m assuming that’s like a bedtime thing.” </li>

                <li> About the data given on the the first report screen - “  I’m pretty sure that 57 DB is NOT quiet. People are talking very loudly right now.” </li>

<p><strong>Some guidance: “Kelvin, could you try and create a log for me?”</strong></p>

                <ul>

                    <li> "I assume that this is what this report button is for." </li>
                    <li> In the ‘what are you doing screen’, he tries to type “working” but the app autocorrects to “workout”</li>
                    <li> “How do I get rid of it? Oh! It’s a toggle… I’m just going to assume that this means off and this means on” </li>
                    <li> In the ‘who are you with’ screen’, he says “These textfields aren’t very responsive” and sees the x on the far right. —> “Oh! — this is what the X is for” </li>


                </ul>


                 <p> <strong> General comments </strong> </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> "The main screen doesn’t need to have statistics because most of the time while I’m opening up the app, i’d be there to make a report”. It would be nice to have if I were to show a friend though. It would be right there” </li>
                    <li> “If I were a first time user, I would have no idea what the awake toggle would do” </li>

                    <li> “This reminds me of AprilZero. He does something similar but with things like Fitbit tracking things for him.” </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p> <strong> Step 2: Brainstorm User Needs </strong></p>


                    <ol>

                        <li> Needs a way to access the nav when there are other notifications on the phone covering the main navigational elements. </li>

                        <li>  Needs a bigger call to action on the home screen for reporting </li>

                        <li> Needs a way to specify which elements are interactive and which are not </li>
                        <li> Needs an explanation for the awake and asleep toggle </li>

                        <li> Needs a way to delete entries individually without deleting the entire input </li>
                        <li> Needs a way to account for subjective preference and record it for future use </li>

                        <li> Needs a way to separate functionality and “coolness”, or separating for the reporting and separating overarching data visuals” </li>

                        <li> Finding a way to make sure that the user knows about autofill, or the textfields will seem unresponsive for no particular reason. </li>

                        <li> Needs some sort of explanation element and instructional tour beyond the loading screen explaining what the app is about and what it does. </li>

                        <li> Needs a reasonable amount of customization, because everyone’s needs are different </li>

                        <li> Needs something that’s actionable afterwards </li>

                    </ol>
